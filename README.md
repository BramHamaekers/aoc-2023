## Summary

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) is an annual Advent calendar of programming puzzles.

My Solutions are in Rust. These solutions are not the best/most efficient. I am learning the language and will use concepts not because they would be the best 
for that problem, but because I want to learn those concepts.
